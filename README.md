# Decap Starter

1. Deploy your site so you can get the assigned URL
  
  - or if you plan to use a custom domain you can set up the github oauth app directly

2. Set up GitHub OAuth app

On GitHub, go to Settings > Developer Settings > OAuth apps > New OAuth app. Or use this [direct link](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).

**Homepage URL**: This must be the prod URL of your application.

**Authorization callback URL**: This must be the prod URL of your application followed by `/oauth/callback`.

3. Set up your config

`/public/admin/config.yml`

- Need to change the `repo`, `sitename`, and `base_url`
- Can change the collections fields or media folder

4. Update env vars and redeploy

- Add your `OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` environmental variables to platform


## How it works

- Hybrid SSR on Vercel
- Github backend of Decap

  - This is why we need SSR
  - We create two endpoints used for auth ( `/oauth` and `/oauth/callback` )
- The decap admin board is preconfigured with preview styles built from the tailwind of our project and to only show the body in the preview ( personal preferences of mine can be removed by removing the scripts in `/pages/admin.astro`)
- If you have a private repo you need to add anyone you want to be able to log into the CMS as a collaborator of the repo
- Tailwind typography for styling the blogs
  - Personally not a fan but I figured it was easy to use and remove
